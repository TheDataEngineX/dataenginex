"""duckdb_memory_limit() must divide the shared DuckDB budget by however many
connections are actually concurrently open, so the SUM of every open
connection's own cap stays within the container's real ceiling.

Previously it was a flat "30% each if more than one connection is open" —
correct only for exactly 2 concurrent connections. With N>2 (now reachable
since the pipeline executor runs real work in parallel instead of
serializing everything through one worker thread), each connection still
independently claimed 30%, so N connections summed to N*30% — e.g. 4
connections summing to 120% of the container's actual RAM, which is exactly
what crashed a live 6.5GB-limited container (DuckDB OOMing internally at
"1.8 GiB/1.8 GiB used", i.e. 30% of 6.5GB, with 4 connections open at once).
