"""DeltaStorage.write() must tolerate additive schema drift by default.

Bronze pipelines capture external API data as-is, and real API responses
have optional/variable-shape nested fields — a later batch can legitimately
have a field the first batch never saw. Previously write_deltalake() was
called with no schema_mode, so the first batch whose inferred schema didn't
exactly match the existing table's schema hard-failed the whole write
(observed live: bronze_tmdb_movie_details failing every run past the first
137-row batch once TMDB returned a movie with an extra nested field).
