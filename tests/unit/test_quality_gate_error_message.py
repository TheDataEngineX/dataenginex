"""The quality-gate failure message must name which check actually failed.

Previously it always printed completeness/uniqueness regardless of which
check(s) caused the failure — silently hiding custom_sql, schema, and
row_count_min failures, and rounding scores to 2 decimals (0.9987 displayed
as "1.00", making a real failure look like a passing score).
