"""Regression test: transform-specific kwargs not in TransformStepConfig's
named fields (e.g. explode's column/alias) must be nested under `options:`
in YAML, and that options dict must actually reach the transform's kwargs.
This was silently broken — options at the wrong YAML level were dropped
with no error until pipeline-run time.
